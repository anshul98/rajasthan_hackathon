It is a web interface which actually removes the middle man between the farmers and the distributors and thereby decreasing the commission between the channel between the two.

It accepts the aadhar card number for authenticity. The farmer then upload the crop details along with the location, thus making it easy for the distributors to search for the desired crop along with the location and price.
